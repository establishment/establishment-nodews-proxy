## License
The Establishment Framework code (including `establishment-nodews-proxy`) is released explicitly under public domain (AKA The Unlicence, I just like public domain more than the term "Unlicence").
There are no ugly copyright headers you need to keep, and you can copy/paste the code without any attribution.
It make it easier to bundle your code, so you know a minimized production js can strip all comments away.
In case you need extra assurance, this software is also licenced under [Creative Commons 0][license-cc0], you can pick your preferred licence.
